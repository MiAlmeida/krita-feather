## Krita Feather Icons

### What is Feather?

Feather is a collection of simply beautiful open source icons. Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

I've added a few of my own (SVG files in **extra-svg** folder):

![Building](./extra-svg/building.svg)
![Desktop](./extra-svg/desktop.svg)
![Laptop](./extra-svg/laptop.svg)
![Trophy](./extra-svg/trophy.svg)

I've only tested this in Krita 4.3
If anyone wants to add their experience with other versions please let me know.

### Install Feather library in Krita 4.3

+ Download the latest version **Feather-Icons.svg** from master
+ In Krita, in the main menu open **Settings** followed by **Manage Resources**
+ In the manage resource window click on **Open Resource Folder**
+ Open the **Symbols** folder
+ Place the downloaded file in this folder
+ Restart Krita

You can now access the library from the **Vector Libraries Docker**.

If you want to customize the icon on your Krita Canvas (change vector points, the stroke or fill color,...) don't forget to right-click the icon on your canvas and select **Ungroup**.
