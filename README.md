## Krita Feather Icons

### What is Feather?

Feather is a collection of simply beautiful open source icons. Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

I've only tested this in Krita 4.3
If anyone wants to add their experience with other versions please let me know.

### Install Feather library in Krita 4.3

+ Download the latest version **Feather-Icons.svg** from master
+ In Krita, in the main menu open **Settings** followed by **Manage Resources**
+ In the manage resource window click on **Open Resource Folder**
+ Open the **Symbols** folder
+ Place the downloaded file in this folder
+ Restart Krita

You can now access the library from the **Vector Libraries Docker**.

If you want to customize the icon on your Krita Canvas (change vector points, the stroke or fill color,...) don't forget to right-click the icon on your canvas and select **Ungroup**.
